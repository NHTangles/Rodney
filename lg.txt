Short !lg help:
---------------

This is a command to query the xlogfile database via Rodney the IRC bot.

!lg <name> <field><operator><value> ...

<name> is an optional player name. It matches the name exactly.
  It can be negated by prefixing with an exclamation mark (!),
  in which case it will match everyone but that player.
  It can also be "*" to match everyone, or "." to match the irc nick
  of the person issuing the !lg command.

<field> can be one of
    	          "version",
                  "points"  (also alias "score"),
                  "deathdnum" (also alias "dungeon"),
                  "deathlev",
                  "maxlvl",
                  "hp",
                  "maxhp",
                  "deaths" (alias: "numdeaths"),
                  "deathdate" (also components "deathyear", "deathmonth" and "deathday"),
                  "birthdate" (also components "birthyear", "birthmonth" and "birthday"),
                  "uid",
                  "role"  (also alias "class"),
                  "race",
                  "gender",
                  "align",
                  "name",
                  "death"    (alias: "killer"),
                  "conduct"  (also alias "conducts"),
		  "nconducts",  (alias: "numconducts"),
                  "turns",
                  "achieve"  (also alias "achievement"),
		  "nachieve",  (alias: "numachieves"),
                  "realtime",
                  "starttime",
                  "endtime",
                  "gender0" (also aliases "orig_gender", etc),
                  "align0"  (also aliases "orig_align", etc)

<operator> can be one of "=~", "=", ">", "<", "<=", ">=", "!=", "<>" or ":=".
           "~=" is an alias of "=~", and "==" is an alias of "=".
           ":=" is an equivalence between two fields, eg. "deathdate:=birthdate"

<value> can be any string (with no spaces) or a number.



-Sorting: You can affect the sorting of the results with "max" and "min".
 They take the equivalence operator and a field name as a value.
 You can use more than one sorting method per query, eg. "max=hp min=points"
 By default queries are sorted by score, descending.

-Conduct: The "conduct" field accepts "=" and "!=" operators, and following values:
        "foodless"    (alias "food"),
        "vegan",
        "vegetarian",
        "atheist"     (alias "godless"),
        "weaponless   (alias "weapon"),
        "pacifist"    (aliases "paci", "pac"),
        "illiterate"  (aliases "illit", "ill"),
        "polypiles",
        "polyself",
        "wishing"     (alias "wish"),
        "artiwishing" (alias "arti"),
        "genocide"    (alias "geno")
   The values can be combined with a pipe or ampersand, for example:
   "conduct=genocide&pacifist"

-Achievement: The "achieve" field accepts "=" and "!=" operators, and following values:
        "get_bell"           (alias: "bell"),
        "enter_gehennom"     (alias: "gehennom", "hell"),
        "get_candelabrum"    (alias: "candelabrum"),
        "get_book"           (alias: "book"),
        "perform_invocation" (alias: "invocation"),
        "get_amulet"         (alias: "amulet"),
        "entered_planes"     (alias: "endgame", "planes"),
        "entered_astral"     (alias: "astral", "astral_plane"),
        "ascended"           (alias: "ascension", "asc"),
        "get_luckstone"      (alias: "luckstone"),
        "finish_sokoban"     (alias: "sokoban"),
        "killed_medusa"      (alias: "medusa")
   The values can be combined with a pipe or ampersand, for example:
   "achieve=sokoban&medusa"

-Death Dungeon: The "deathdnum" field accepts a number, or following values:
      "dod"       (alias "dungeons"),
      "gehennom"  (alias "hell"),
      "mines",
      "quest",
      "sokoban"   (alias "soko"),
      "ludios"    (alias "fort_ludios"),
      "vlad",
      "planes",   (alias "plane"),
      "astral",   (alias "astral_plane"),
      "water",    (alias "water_plane"),
      "fire",     (alias "fire_plane"),
      "air",      (alias "air_plane"),
      "earth",    (alias "earth_plane")

-Death Level:  The "deathlev" field accepts a number, or a name of one of the planes,
 as above.

-Death Reason:  The value supplied to "death" field does some string mangling:
 All underscores (_) are replaced with spaces,
 all full stops (.) and percentages (%) match any one character, and
 all asterisks (*) match zero or more of any characters.

-Realtime:  The realtime-field accepts values in "1h2m3s" format, or plain
 seconds. eg. "!lg * max=realtime realtime<=3h"

-The operator "=~" is special and accepts values separated by a pipe;
 the query will match any one of the values. For example:
 "!lg * death=~escaped|quit"

-Displaying fields: Any valid field names -- that come after the player name -- listed
 without an operator and a value are shown in the query results.
 For example: "!lg * hp maxhp"
 To prevent a field from showing up in the result listing, use "hide=field"

 It's also possible to display the following aggregate functions of fields:
 "avg", "count", "max", "min", "sum". For example: "!lg * won avg(turns)"

-Valid 3-character names for race, role, gender and alignment -- that come after
 the player name -- separated by spaces are considered.  Prefixing any of those
 with an exclamation mark (!) will negate it.

-Fields that accept a date ("birthdate", "deathdate", "starttime" and "endtime")
 can also accept "today" as a value.

-Aliases: There are some aliases that can be used:
 "ascended" and "won"  equal to "death=ascended",
 "quit" is equal to "death=quit",
 "escaped" is equal to "death=escaped", and
 "escaped|quit" or "quit|escaped" matches either,
 "character" is equal to "role race gender align", or displaying those fields in that order.

-Dumpfile: You can get an URLs to the dumpfiles with "-dump".
 For example: "!lg -dump * won max=turns"
 Note: Games played before March 18th 2008 do not have dump files.
 To ensure you get a game with a dumpfile, add "starttime>0"

-TTYREC files: You can get an URL to the game ttyrec file with "-ttyrec".
 For example: "!lg -ttyrec * won min=score starttime>0"

-Number of matches: use "-count" to get the number of matching entries,
 for example: "!lg -count * won"

-Grouping: You can "group" results with "g", "gmax" or "gmin".
 For example "!lg * won g=race" would list top counts of winning races.
 "gmax" is equal to "g" and "gmin" reverses the sorting.

-Skipping entries: You can use "skip=N" to skip the first N entries,
 for example "!lg * skip=5"

-Limiting entries: You can limit output with "limit=N" to N entries,
 for example "!lg * won limit=1"

-Queries in the queue can be cancelled with !rmlg.

!lg * won						List top 5 highest scoring people who have ascended.
